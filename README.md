A Product Engineer who enjoys turning ideas into solutions that people genuinely want to use. Over the past few years, I’ve contributed to products across fintech, edtech, and SaaS, where I’ve helped improve performance, reduce costs, and support business growth in multiple markets. What excites me most is solving real-world problems—whether that means building tools that make teams more efficient, enhancing user experiences, or developing systems that scale globally. I take pride in owning features end-to-end, working closely with stakeholders, and delivering results that create both user and business impact. Looking ahead, I’m eager to bring this blend of problem-solving, ownership, and product thinking to a team that’s passionate about building meaningful products.
